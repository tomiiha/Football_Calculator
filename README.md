# Football Scraping and Calculation tool

scraping_tool.py has been created to capture website data (fbref.com), that can be then fed into the season_calcs.py engine. This will run some simple metrics to track team performance.

Data URLs.xlsx file will contain all the URLs from FBREF, that can be parsed for purposes. Used to feed the parsers to capture the data you're after.

League Two/League One Teams per Season files will contain all the teams that played in the two leagues, for each consecutive season used in the data sets. Plan is to use this to plot the data parsing for a season at a time.
